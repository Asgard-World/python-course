#
# Question:
# Define a function that can accept an integer number as input and print the "It is an even number" if the number is
# even, otherwise print "It is an odd number".
#
# Hints:
#
# Use % operator to check if a number is even or odd.

#
# Question:
# Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 3 (both included) and the
# values are square of keys.
#
# Hints:
#
# Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.
#
#

#
# Question:
# Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the
# values are square of keys.
#
# Hints:
#
# Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.
# Use range() for loops.
#
#
# #----------------------------------------#

#
# Question:
# Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and
# the values are square of keys. The function should just print the values only.
#
# Hints:
#
# Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.
# Use range() for loops.
# Use keys() to iterate keys in the dictionary. Also we can use item() to get key/value pairs.

# Question:
# Define a function which can generate and print a list where the values are square of numbers between
# 1 and 20 (both included).
#
# Hints:
#
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.
# Use range() for loops.
# Use list.append() to add values into a list.
#
#
# #----------------------------------------#

#
# Question:
# Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).
# Then the function needs to print the first 5 elements in the list.
#
# Hints:
#
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.
# Use range() for loops.
# Use list.append() to add values into a list.
# Use [n1:n2] to slice a list
#

#
# Question:
# Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).
# Then the function needs to print the last 5 elements in the list.
#
# Hints:
#
# Use ** operator to get power of a number.
# Use range() for loops.

# half values in one line.
#
# Hints:
#

#
#
# #----------------------------------------#
# 2.10
#
# Question:
# Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given
# tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).
#
# Hints:
